We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community.  We will not tolerate the following in our community:
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, physical appearance, body size, and/or disability
- Use of sexual language or imagery at any time
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or events
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior

We expect all participants to be respectful of others, their time, and resources.  Being a participant in this community does not guarantee or entitle you to specific help, time or resources from community leaders or participants.
 
If participants feel unsafe or unwelcome, or notice that someone else is being harassed, please report it as soon as possible.  You can make a report by [contacting us](http://kcwomenintech.org/contact/) or speaking with one of the organizers of the event you are attending.
 
We expect event organizers and volunteers to be alert and take appropriate action to intervene in preventing or stopping harassment and unacceptable behavior. 
 
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants.  This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund (for paid events).
